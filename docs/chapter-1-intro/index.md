# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

## Welcome to Physical AI

Welcome to the exciting world of Physical AI - where artificial intelligence meets the real world through robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other embodied systems. This chapter serves as your foundation for understanding how AI systems interact with and learn from their physical environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Define Physical AI** and explain how it differs from traditional digital AI systems
2. **Understand embodied intelligence** and why physical embodiment changes how AI systems learn and behave
3. **Identify fundamental sensor types** used in humanoid robots (LIDAR, cameras, IMU, force/torque sensors)
4. **Explain the purpose and capabilities** of each major sensor category
5. **Recognize current humanoid robotics platforms** and their application domains
6. **Understand the course structure**, including the 4 modules and 13-week progression
7. **Describe the capstone project** goal and how the modules prepare you for it

## What You'll Learn

This chapter covers the conceptual foundations you need before diving into hands-on implementation in Modules 1-4:

- **[What is Physical AI?](01-what-is-physical-ai.md)** - Core concepts and definitions
- **[Embodied Intelligence](02-embodied-intelligence.md)** - Why physical embodiment matters
- **[Sensor Fundamentals](03-sensor-fundamentals.md)** - LIDAR, cameras, IMU, and force sensors
- **[Industry Landscape](04-industry-landscape.md)** - Current platforms and career opportunities
- **[Course Overview](05-course-overview.md)** - 4 modules, 13 weeks, and the capstone project
- **[Self-Assessment](06-self-assessment.md)** - Test your understanding

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- **Basic programming knowledge** (Python or similar language)
- **Introductory AI concepts** (what neural networks are, basic ML terminology)
- **Curiosity about robotics** - no prior robotics experience required!

## Time Investment

- **Reading Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Self-Assessment**: 30 minutes
- **Total Chapter Time**: 2.5-3.5 hours

## Why This Matters

Physical AI represents the next frontier of artificial intelligence. While digital AI has transformed software, Physical AI is transforming the physical world - from warehouse automation to autonomous vehicles to humanoid assistants. Understanding these foundations will prepare you for the rapidly growing field of embodied AI and robotics engineering.

## Getting Started

Begin with **[Section 1: What is Physical AI?](01-what-is-physical-ai.md)** to establish core concepts, then progress through the chapter sequentially. Each section builds on previous knowledge.
